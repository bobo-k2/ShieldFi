- **Solflare** (@solaborative) — Same angle
- **Backpack** (@Backpack) — Newer wallet, might be more responsive

**Security/Analytics:**

```
Subject: Free security tool for [Project] community

Hey [Name],

I built ShieldFi — a free Solana wallet scanner that detects fake tokens, 
scam airdrops, and suspicious activity in any wallet.

I'd love to offer free scans to your community. No catch — the tool is 
free. Just thought [Project] users would benefit from knowing what's 
lurking in their wallets.

Would you be open to a quick mention or collaboration?

Site: https://shieldfi.app
Scan any wallet in 10 seconds.

— Bobo
```

### Reddit
- [ ] r/solana: Case study post — "I scanned the top 10 most-reported scam wallets on Solana. Here's what I found."
- [ ] Comment in every scam/rug discussion with helpful analysis + link

### Twitter
- [ ] Tag partner projects in relevant tweets
- [ ] Create a Twitter thread: "10 Solana wallets you should NEVER interact with" (with ShieldFi scan data)
- [ ] Start a Twitter poll: "Have you ever received a fake token in your Solana wallet?" (engagement bait)

---

## Week 4 (Mar 22–28): Scale & Optimize

### Reddit
- [ ] r/solana: "1 month of scanning Solana wallets — stats & findings" (data post with graphs)
- [ ] r/CryptoCurrency: Same data post for broader reach
- [ ] r/ethfinance or r/ethereum: "Solana dev here — built a free wallet scanner. Would the ETH community want something similar?" (cross-pollination)

### Twitter
- [ ] Publish "Month 1 Report" thread with real data (wallets scanned, scams detected, patterns)
- [ ] Run "Free Scan Friday" — scan any wallet replied to the tweet
- [ ] Engage with trending Solana narratives (new token launches, rug pulls in the news)

### Discord
- [ ] Host a voice chat "AMA: Solana Wallet Security" (even if 5 people show up)
- [ ] Create roles: Beta Tester, Early Supporter, Guardian, Sentinel
- [ ] Tease upcoming features to build anticipation

### Conversion
- [ ] Add "Why upgrade?" section to shieldfi.app — compare free vs Guardian vs Sentinel

### Comment Engagement Rules
- Search daily for: "solana scam", "fake token solana", "solana wallet hacked", "rug pull solana"
- Provide genuinely helpful analysis FIRST, mention ShieldFi SECOND
- Never cold-link without context — always explain what it does
- Upvote and engage with other security-related posts (build karma)

- @SOLBigBrain — Engage with Solana alpha posts

### Tier 2: Offer Value (Weeks 2-3)
DM with a free offer, no strings attached.

```

I built a free wallet scanner (shieldfi.app) — thought you might 
find it useful for your research. Happy to run scans on any wallets 
you're investigating.

No ask — just thought it might help. 🤙
```

### Tier 3: Collaborate (Weeks 3-4)
- Offer to co-create content: "Want to do a collab thread on the biggest Solana scams this month?"
- Offer free premium access to anyone with >5k followers who wants to try it
- Ask for honest feedback publicly: "Hey @[KOL], tried ShieldFi yet? Would love your honest take."
