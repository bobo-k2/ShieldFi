## Tweet 2 (Problem)
98.6% of tokens launched on Pump.fun are rug pulls.

$750M+ stolen on Solana since launch.

Your wallet is a minefield. Most people don't even know what's in it.

ShieldFi changes that.

## Tweet 3 (How it works)
Paste any Solana address → instant security scan:

🔍 Token risk analysis (verified / suspicious / fake)
⚠️ Fake token detection ("FAKE USDC" impersonation flagging)
🔓 Spender & approval analysis
📊 AI-powered contract risk scoring

No wallet connect needed. Check anyone's wallet.

## Tweet 4 (Monitoring)
Real-time wallet monitoring with Telegram alerts 🔔

ShieldFi watches your wallet 24/7 and pings you when:
→ Suspicious tokens appear
→ New approvals are granted
→ Large transfers happen

Set it and forget it.

## Tweet 5 (What makes us different)
Why ShieldFi vs everything else?

✅ Public lookup — scan ANY wallet, no connect
✅ Real-time Telegram alerts (nobody else does this)
✅ AI risk analysis at zero cost
