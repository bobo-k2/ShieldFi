# Product Hunt Launch — ShieldFi

## Tagline
Free Solana wallet security scanner — detect fake tokens instantly

## Description
ShieldFi scans any Solana wallet address and flags suspicious tokens, impersonation attempts, and fake authorities. No wallet connect needed — just paste an address.

Built because 98%+ of tokens on Solana are scams, and most people have no idea what's sitting in their wallet.

**Features:**
- Paste any wallet address → instant security scan
- AI-powered token risk analysis (verified / suspicious / spam)
- Fake token detection (catches USDC impersonators etc.)
- Real-time Telegram alerts for wallet monitoring
- Completely free, no sign-up required

Solana-only by design. Deep coverage > shallow multi-chain.

## Maker comment (post after launch)
Hey everyone! I built ShieldFi after finding a bunch of fake tokens in my Solana wallet — including ones impersonating USDC.

Most wallet security tools try to cover every chain and end up doing none of them well. ShieldFi focuses exclusively on Solana so we can go deeper on detection.

Try it out — just paste any Solana wallet address. No wallet connect, no sign-up. Would love to hear what you think!
